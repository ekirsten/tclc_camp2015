				<h2>Three Pillars of Web Design</h2>

		<p>	Welcome! This site explores the interaction of html, css, and javascript to create more interactive web content. </p>

		<h3>what are we learning?</h3>
		<p>html, css and javascript are the main building blocks for all webpages. Even as we get into more dynamic sites built by programs, these three pillars remain relevant and important. </p>
			<ul><li>html</li>
				<p>html is the language browsers use to interpret information. No matter what programming language is used to generate a page, the information is conveyed to the browser in terms of html. </p>
				<li>css</li>
				<p>css provides the styling information for html. It works off of html elements. It is the css decides how content should appear. This content here is in a paragraph. If I were to go into the css and change the styling for p elements, this might look a lot different (give it a try!)</p>

				<li>javascript</li>

				<p>javascript is a scripting language commonly used to add more dynamic features to html pages. Nowadays, there are many languages used to generate html pages, but javascript support is ubiquitous and allows us as users to add dynamic features to systems we don't have complete control over. In a way, javascript is the most easily expunged of the core three - it tells the css and html what to do, but so can other languages. However, it is so widely supported that it is probably the most useful of the three in influencing functionality across various platforms. It can complete tasks, it can add interactivity, it can work with data and modify static content - and you can be pretty sure it will work no matter where you are on the web, whether on libguides or sirsi or blackboard. </p>
			</ul>
		<h3>Why learn these skills?</h3>

		Most people are not going to design a website from scratch these days. But you can still use this information in conjunction with pretty much every modern web service you encounter. Knowing these three tools allows you to better customize the systems you use on a daily basis. 

		<h3>What should I learn?</h3>
	
	You don't need to memorize every html tag or css property and value. What you do need to know is what you can accomplish, the basic syntax, and where to look for more information. Unless your career is web developer, you're probably going to have to look things up. And that's okay. We're librarians, it's what we do. Knowing where to look and what to look for - that's the key.

			<h2>What it does</h2>

		html adds structure to a document. Way back when, it might have been used for styling, but now it pretty much just labels content which is moved around and styled with css. There are a lot of built in features with html5 which add increased functions, such as video (especially video), but at its core html remains a language of organization, of sorting. Html provides the structure - it's like a middle school teacher. 

		<h2>Why it's important</h2>

		We mentioned it before, but still html seems oldschool, right? But the fact is, everything communicates in terms of html. You can learn the hippest programming language, but if you want to use it to design websites, you need to know how to talk html. It is the language of the web, like it or not. Most people simply like it - after all, it 's a clean, simple system. It does little, and you get little in return, but you get all you expected.

		<div class="main-content-tab" id="css-content-tab">
				CSS or cascading style sheets is the design module of the web. It's where you add color, control font, modify visibility, etc. There are three ways to go about style: internal, external, and inline. 
<ul><li>
	in-line</li>
	<p>in-line styling is the least supported. It involves style invoked on individual html element. It is tedious and difficult, but sometimes necessary when you can't control style on a larger scale</p>

	<li>internal style sheets</p>

		Internal style sheets apply styles on a page by page basis. They are often generated by programs - that is, they are common when websites not written by hand. They have the advantage over in-line styling of concentrating style information, but fall behind external style sheets in that they need to be updated page by page.
