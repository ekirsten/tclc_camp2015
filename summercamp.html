				<h2>Three Pillars of Web Design</h2>
				<p>	Welcome! This site explores the interaction of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create more
				interactive web content.</p>

				<h3>What are we learning?</h3>
				<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the main building blocks for all webpages. Even as we get
				into more dynamic sites built by programs, these three pillars remain relevant and
				important.</p>

				<dl>
						<dt>HTML</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>HTML is the language browsers use to interpret information. No matter what
							programming language is used to generate a page, the information is conveyed to the
							browser in terms of HTML.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt>CSS</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>CSS provides the styling information for HTML. It works off of HTML elements; it is
							the CSS that decides how content should appear.</p>
							<p>This content here is in a paragraph; if I were to go into the CSS and change the
							styling for &lt;p&gt; elements, this might look a lot different (give it a try!).</p>
						</dd>

						<dt>JavaScript</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>JavaScript is a scripting language commonly used to add more dynamic features to
							HTML pages. Nowadays, there are many languages used to generate HTML pages, but
							JavaScript support is ubiquitous and allows us as users to add dynamic features to
							systems we don’t have complete control over.<p>
							<p>In a way, JavaScript is the most easily expunged of the core three – it tells the
							CSS and HTML what to do, but so can other languages. However, it is so widely
							supported that it is probably the most useful of the three in influencing
							functionality across various platforms. It can complete tasks, it can add
							interactivity, it can work with data and modify static content – and you can be pretty
							sure it will work no matter where you are on the web, whether on LibGuides or Sirsi or
							Blackboard.</p>
						</dd>
				</ul>

				<h3>Why learn these skills?</h3>
				<p>Most people are not going to design a website from scratch these days, but you can still
				use this information in conjunction with pretty much every modern web service you encounter.
				Knowing these three tools allows you to better customize the systems you use on a daily
				basis.</p>

				<h3>What should I learn?</h3>
				<p>You don’t need to memorize every HTML tag or css property and value; what you do need to
				know is what you can accomplish, the basic syntax, and where to look for more
				information.</p>
				<p>Unless your career is web developer, you’re probably going to have to look things up –
				and that’s okay. We’re librarians, it’s what we do. Knowing where to look and what to look
				for – that’s the key.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="main-content-tab" id="html-content-tab">
				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<p>HTML adds structure to a document. Way back when, it might have been used for styling,
				but now it pretty much just labels content which is moved around and styled with CSS. There
				are a lot of built-in features with HTML5 which add increased functions, such as (and
				especially) video, but at its core HTML remains a language of organization, of sorting. HTML
				provides the structure – it’s like a middle school teacher.</p>

				<h2>Why it’s important</h2>
				<p>We mentioned it before, but still HTML seems oldschool, right? But the fact is,
				everything communicates in terms of HTML. You can learn the hippest programming language,
				but if you want to use it to design websites, you need to know how to talk HTML. It is the
				language of the web, like it or not. Most people simply like it: after all, it’s a clean,
				simple system; it does little, and you get little in return, but you get all you
				expected.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>elements</li>
					<li>attributes</li>
					<li>nesting and closing</li>
					<li>essential tags</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="main-content-tab" id="css-content-tab">
				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<p>CSS or cascading style sheets is the design module of the web. It’s where you add color,
				control font, modify visibility, etc. There are three ways to go about style: internal,
				external, and inline.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>inline</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In-line styling is the least supported. It produces style applied to individual HTML
						element. It is tedious and difficult, but sometimes necessary when you can’t control
						style on a larger scale.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>internal style sheets</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Internal style sheets apply styles on a page by page basis. They are often generated
						by programs – that is, they are common when websites not written by hand. They have the
						advantage over in-line styling of concentrating style information, but fall behind
						external style sheets in that they need to be updated page by page.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</div>

			<div class="main-content-tab" id="javascript-content-tab">
				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is often used to add dynamic elements to web content; it does this by altering
				the HTML and CSS. JavaScript isn't the only language that can do this: you could replace the
				JavaScript, but always need to speak to the browser in HTML and CSS. It is, however, the
				most common and is supported by the browser. Other languages you could use to modify content
				might have requirements on the server side, which makes them harder to use across multiple
				platforms.</p>

				<h2>Features and events</h2>
				<p>JavaScript can be loaded immediately with the page or can be triggered based on a click.
				We can see examples of each within this html document.</p>
				<p>JavaScript operates using functions, which are basically a set of instructions to carry
				out a certain task. When you click in the navigation bar, you set off a function which hides
				some content and shows other content. The pictures on top are rotated by a function which
				changes the image source after a certain interval.</p>
